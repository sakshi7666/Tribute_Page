        <h2>Biography</h2>
      </div>

      <p>A spiritual genius of commanding intellect and power, Vivekananda crammed immense labor and achievement into
        his short life, 1863-1902. Born in the Datta family of Calcutta, the youthful Vivekananda embraced the agnostic
        philosophies
        of the Western mind along with the worship of science. At the same time, vehement in his desire to know the
        truth about God, he questioned people of holy reputation, asking them if they had seen God. He found such a
        person
        in Sri Ramakrishna, who became his master, allayed his doubts, gave him God vision, and transformed him into
        sage and prophet with authority to teach. After Sri Ramakrishna's death, Vivekananda renounced the world and
        criss-crossed
        India as a wandering monk. His mounting compassion for India's people drove him to seek their material help from
        the West. Accepting an opportunity to represent Hinduism at Chicago's Parliament of Religions in 1893,
        Vivekananda
        won instant celebrity in America and a ready forum for his spiritual teaching. For three years he spread the
        Vedanta philosophy and religion in America and England and then returned to India to found the Ramakrishna Math
        and Mission. Exhorting his nation to spiritual greatness, he wakened India to a new national consciousness. He
        died July 4, 1902, after a second, much shorter sojourn in the West. His lectures and writings have been
        gathered
        into nine volumes. <a class="btn btn-primary btn-xs" href="#">More &raquo;</a></p>

    </div>
    <p>
    <h4>Birth and childhood(1863–88)</h4>
    Vivekananda was born Narendranath Datta (shortened to Narendra or Naren)at his ancestral home at 3 Gourmohan
    Mukherjee Street in Calcutta,the capital of British India, on 12 January 1863 during the Makar Sankranti festival.
    He belonged to a traditional
    Bengali Kayastha family and was one of nine siblings. His father, Vishwanath Datta, was an attorney at the Calcutta
    High Court. Durgacharan Datta, Narendra's grandfather was a Sanskrit and Persian scholar who left his family
    and became a monk at age twenty-five. His mother, Bhubaneswari Devi, was a devout housewife. The progressive,
    rational attitude of Narendra's father and the religious temperament of his mother helped shape his thinking
    and personality.

    the only student to receive
    first-division marks in the Presidency College entrance examination. He was an avid reader in a wide range of
    subjects, including philosophy, religion, history, social science, art and literature.He was also interested
    in Hindu scriptures, including the Vedas, the Upanishads, the Bhagavad Gita, the Ramayana, the Mahabharata and the

    sports and organised activities. Narendra studied Western logic, Western philosophy and European history at the

    <h4>Spiritual apprenticeship - influence of Brahmo Samaj</h4>
    In 1880 Narendra joined Keshab Chandra Sen's Nava Vidhan, which was established by Sen after meeting Ramakrishna and
    reconverting from Christianity to Hinduism. Narendra became a member of a Freemasonry lodge "at some point before
    1884"and of the Sadharan
    Brahmo Samaj in his twenties, a breakaway faction of the Brahmo Samaj led by Keshab Chandra Sen and Debendranath
    Tagore. From 1881 to 1884 he was also active in Sen's Band of Hope, which tried to discourage youths from
    smoking and drinking. <a class="btn btn-primary btn-xs"
